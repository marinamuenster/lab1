I understand the general gist of what I'm trying to accoplish. And I think that I'm pretty close. 

What I'm stuck on is understanding the format of the data (I think) I'm pulling from my Arduino via the serial port. Because I found the line that's supposed to change to the color of the window background, but my attempts to run the program are giving me an invalid argument error. So that's where I am currently stuck.
